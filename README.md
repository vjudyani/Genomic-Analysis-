SARS-CoV-2 Genome Analysis

## Introduction

SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, is being studied using bioinformatics to better understand how it functions and to find potential treatment targets. We are focusing on identifying the genes in its genome that help it infect cells, replicate, and evade the immune system. By comparing these genes to those of other viruses, we can predict their roles and identify possible drug targets.

To do this, we look for sections of the genome that might code for proteins, known as open reading frames (ORFs). We filter out any that are too short to be functional and verify our predictions using specialized algorithms. Before applying this method to SARS-CoV-2, we first test it on *E. coli*, a well-studied bacterium, to make sure our approach is accurate. This step-by-step process ensures reliable results while reducing errors that would need further experimental testing.

This project aims to provide a structured bioinformatics pipeline for analyzing the SARS-CoV-2 genome, identifying key protein-coding genes, and exploring their functional roles.

Setup Instructions

1. Set Up Environment

Create a working directory:

mkdir sars_cov2_analysis
cd sars_cov2_analysis

2. Install Required Packages

Ensure Python and necessary dependencies are available:

module load python 
pip install biopython matplotlib jupyterlab seaborn pandas

Gene Prediction and Validation

Download and Analyze the SARS-CoV-2 Genome

Fetch the SARS-CoV-2 genome using Biopython:

from Bio import Entrez
Entrez.email = "your.email@charlotte.edu"
handle = Entrez.efetch(db="nucleotide", id="NC_045512", rettype="fasta", retmode="text")
with open("sars_cov2.fasta", "w") as output_file:
    output_file.write(handle.read())
handle.close()

Identify Open Reading Frames (ORFs)

Use the following function to identify ORFs in the SARS-CoV-2 genome:

from Bio import SeqIO

def find_orfs(seq_record, min_length=30):
    """Identify ORFs in a given sequence."""
    ... # ORF detection code here

Protein Hydrophobicity Analysis

Generate a Protein FASTA File

Export ORFs as protein sequences:

def export_trimmed_proteins(orfs, output_filename):
    """Save protein sequences in FASTA format."""
    ... # Protein export function here

Compute Hydrophobicity

Load hydrophobicity values and analyze protein sequences:

import pandas as pd
hydro_table = load_hydrophobicity_table("aminoacid_properties.csv")
sars_cov2_data = calculate_hydrophobicities("sars_cov2_proteome.fasta", hydro_table)
df = pd.DataFrame(sars_cov2_data)

Comparative Viral Genome Analysis

Download Viral Metadata

Visit NCBI Virus

Download a randomized subset (20 records per host category) as a CSV file

Rename it to viral_metadata.csv and upload it to the working directory
